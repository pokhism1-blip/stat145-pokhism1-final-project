# pokhism1-final_project.R
My replication package for my STA-145 final project examines the relationship between cultural relevance and the presence of article maps in The New York Times articles. I collected and analyzed data on multiple characteristics, and I aimed to determine whether articles that include maps are more culturally relevant than those that do not. 
# instructions 
To access and utilize the script, open the "pokhism1-final_project.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "data.csv" file. 
# data 
The data collected for this project came from articles in the New York Times. Given the New York Times's wide range of articles, the main goal of the analysis is to determine whether there is a relationship between cultural relevance and the presence of article maps. 
# operationalization 
To operationalize cultural relevance, I reviewed New York Times articles and recorded them as strong, moderate, weak, or no relevance. 
I also did the same to determine which geographic focus, reviewing each article and recording whether or not it contains maps.
